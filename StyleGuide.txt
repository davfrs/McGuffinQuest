Style Guidelines:
 1. English is to be the only spoken language used in the code.
 2. Indentations are to be done using 4 spaces. Tabs are not allowed.
 3. When incrementing/decrementing a variable on a seperate line, it must be done using postfix operators.
 4. Braces are not required after loops or conditionals when only one statement would be in the braces. Using them in such a case is allowed, however.
 5. When using braces to accompany a loop or conditional, as well as a method/function body, the opening brace goes on the same line as the controlling loop/conditional, or definition of the method/function.
 6. End braces go on a seperate line all by themselves, unless used for ending a lambda that contains a single statement, or for try-catch blocks.
 7. When using exception handling, opening braces go on the same line as the try /catch declaration. Closing braces go on the same line as the following catch block, if one exists. Opening and closing braces must be on different lines for exception handling.
 8. When using a for-each loop, the variable name is to be either "e" or "each". In the event there is a nested for-each loop, the inner loop will use the variable "e2" -- subsiquent inner for-each loops then increment the number after the e.
 9. The names of variables are to be done in "camelCase" style.
10. The names of structs, as well as struct-like classes, are to be full upper-case.
11. Global constants and #defines are to be full upper-case. If the name needs to be more than one word, the two words are seperated by an underscore.
12. The names of enums and non-struct-like classes are to start with an upper-case letter, followed by lower-case. If multiple words are used in the naming, each first letter of each word is upper-cased. ("CamelCase")
13. When declaring methods with empty bodies, such as constuctors that only use member initialization lists, the start and end braces can be on the same line, with no more than 1 space between them.
